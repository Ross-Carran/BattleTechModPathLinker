# BattleTechModPathLinker
Mass Symbolic linker

At the moment This can be used with Dotnet 7.0+ minor upgrades I think
After compile you can either use the binary or use dotnet BattleTechModPathLinker.dll destinationdir sourcedir [--S] to link subfolders only.
just think of the .dll like a Java .jar file.
This will get more work, just its rudementary functionality is good enough to make an annoying menial task a bit easier.
Should work on both Windows and Linux. tested and run on Ubuntu 22.04 with whatever dotnetsdk is currently being pushed 7.?
